# Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, machine learning systems improve their performance through experience and by finding patterns in data.

# How Machine Learning Works
At its core, machine learning involves feeding a large amount of data into a computer algorithm and allowing the system to learn from that data to make decisions or predictions. The process typically involves the following steps:

# Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three main types:

1.Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output based on the provided labels. Examples include:

Classification: Identifying the category of an object (e.g., spam email detection).
Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., housing price prediction).

2.Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the model is given data without labeled responses. The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures within the data. Examples include:

Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables in the data (e.g., principal component analysis).

3.Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agent aims to maximize its cumulative reward over time. Examples include:

Game Playing: Teaching AI to play and win games (e.g., AlphaGo).
Robotics: Enabling robots to learn tasks through trial and error (e.g., autonomous navigation).
